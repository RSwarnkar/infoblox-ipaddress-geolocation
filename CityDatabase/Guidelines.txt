# Import IP Address Mappings from a CSV File
#
# It is also possible to import a lot of IP address mappings using a CSV file.
# Note that the CSV file must not contain errors otherwise the import will abort.
#
# Requirements for the CSV file:
#  - has to be ANSI or UTF-8 encoded
#  - allowed delimiters are comma, semicolon and tab
#  - use double quotes if a value contains a delimiter
#  - escape double quotes inside a value with a preceding double quote
#  - valid values for country and region are the same as shown in the drop-down menus when manually adding a mapping
#  - it is recommended to use two letter ISO country codes (ISO Alpha-2) instead of names (e.g. "US" instead of "United States of America")
#  - latitude and longitude must be between -180 and 180, don't use more than 2 decimal places. Both values must be valid or the coordinates will be ignored
#  - it is recommended to provide coordinates for city mappings. Otherwise a lookup is performed and the CSV file can't be imported if no coordinates are found
#  - an IP range can also be defined using a subnetmask (e.g. 192.168.1.1/24). This is only allowed in the first column. If IP-to is also provided, the subnetmask will be ignored
#
# The columns of one CSV line are as follows:
#   IP/IP-from, IP-to (optional), country name or code, region name or code, city (optional), latitude (optional), longitude (optional)
#
#
# Some examples:
192.168.1.1,AT,09,Vienna (Dynatrace Austria), 48.20, 16.37
192.169.1.1,192.169.1.255,US,"New York"
192.170.1.1/16,US,"New York","US ""HQ""", 40.73, -73.93
